# Test Story 1

As a product manager,
I want to write user stories in markdown and upload them to Pivotal Tracker,
so that I can do less work setting them up.

Notes:
* Asterisk bullet points would be ignored as part of the description.

Tags: Enterprise, Action Plan

- Every # header should begin a new story.
- Tags should be prefixed by 'Tags:' and be comma seperated.
- Tasks should appear at the end as a hyphen bullet point.
- Each bullet point should be a new task.

# Test Story 2

As a test story,
I want to be registered as a separate story without all the bells and whistles,
so that we know the app is working.
