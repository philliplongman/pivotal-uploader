# Test Feature

As a product manager,
I want to write user stories in markdown and upload them to Pivotal Tracker,
so that I can do less work setting them up.

Notes:
* Asterisk bullet points should be ignored as part of the description.

Labels: example feature, pretend label

- Every # header should begin a new story.
- Tags should be prefixed by 'Tags:' and be comma separated.
- Tasks should appear at the end as a hyphen bullet point.
- Each bullet point should be a new task.



# Test Bug (bug)

This is a bug. Something is wrong with the example feature. This story has a label.

Labels: example feature



# Test Chore (chore)

This is a chore, and isn't written with all those bells and whistles.
