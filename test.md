# Example feature

As a product manager,
I want to write user stories in markdown and upload them to Pivotal Tracker,
so that I can do less work setting them up.

Notes:
* Asterisk bullet points should be ignored as part of the description.

Labels: example epic, example feature, pretend label

- Every # header should begin a new story.
- Labels should be prefixed by 'Labels:' and be comma-separated.
- Tasks should appear at the end as a hyphen bullet point.
- Story type should be at the end of the story name.
